Here's a brief summary of the methodology used in the code:

Load the required packages: The packages dplyr, tidyr, readr, ggplot2, ggbiplot, usmap, and data.table are loaded.

Load and clean the data: The "countypres.csv" file is read in using the read_csv function from readr. Rows with party other than "REPUBLICAN" and totalvotes less than or equal to 0 are removed. The data is then pivoted wider so that the different election years are represented as columns. The county_fips column is renamed as fips.

Summarize the data: The data is summarized by county by selecting the fips column and columns representing the election years 2000 to 2020. The values for each county are summed across election years.

Visualize the data: The summarized data is gathered so that the election year columns become rows. A ggplot is created with x-axis representing the election year, y-axis representing the vote ratio for each county, and each line representing a county.

Perform PCA: The prcomp function from data.table is used to perform Principal Component Analysis on the summarized data with scaling.

Visualize the PCA results: Summary statistics and structure of the PCA object are viewed using the summary and str functions, respectively. The ggbiplot function is used to create a biplot of the first two principal components.

Plot county vote estimates on a US map: The usmap package is used to create a blank map of US counties. The first principal component is added to the summarized data using cbind. The plot_usmap function is used to create a choropleth map of the county vote estimates with the first principal component as the variable being mapped. The map is color-coded using a gradient fill, and the title and subtitle are added using labs.
